This is a document where I have written the ideas I had for the Southerners faction, which is momentarily unbalanced.

Faction name stays the same.

Rename the southern elf race to 'desert elf.' Southernern Elf was too long.

Units:

Level 1           Level 2             Level 3

Desert Hunter --> Desert Warrior   --> Desert Champion/Swordsmaster/Elite Warrior
             \--> Desert Chieftain --> Desert Great Chieftain

Desert Archer --> Desert Marksman  --> Desert Sharpshooter

Desert Guardsman --> Desert Sentinel

Carapace -->     Gallant Carapace --> Warrior Carapace

Dust Devil --> custom advancements

             /--> Desert Druid
Desert Mystic --> Desert Sun Enchantress --> Desert Sun Sorceress
             \--> Desert Moon Priestess --> Desert Moon Shyde

Faction Info:

It is a coalition of the southern nations of Arkenova, excluding the dwarves, minotaurs, mermen and wood elves. The faction is based on both offensive & defensive tactics, making it capable of standing a fair chance against any faction.

Unit Statistics:

All desert elves receive 50% defence in sand and forest terrain and the movement penalty is one. They are slower and more vulnerable in icy/snowy terrain, but more agile and better adapted for cave crawling. The dexterous trait is not available to them, but the traits strong, resilient, intelligent, quick, and healthy are observed. Since they are elves, they have a -10% resistance to arcane damage.
