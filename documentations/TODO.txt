DEEP ELVES

- Seer NEW ATTACK: Energy Ball 9-4 arcane ranged +first-strike , melee damage increase to 7-3 , price to 56g (+8g)

MISC

7) Axet Thrower too high melee+ranged damage in all levels. Low HP on lv2, maybe recheck to see if there is something wrong, but I find unit too powerful.

9) Steel Wyrm too powerful melee for also 6-2 backstab, still low RES, just a mention so you can recheck if there is something wrong in here.

10) Steel Splicer capable to defeat in 1vs1 a lv2 figther and being a berserking unit, indeed very overpowered.

11) Steel Vorpal melee damages too high (11-4) to also get +slows special.
