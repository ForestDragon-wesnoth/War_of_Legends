MISC

1) Legion Elite Longbowman poison ranged is 7-2 while lv2 is 6-2 and lv1 is 5-2 . Obviously higher level longbowman poison attacks are underpowered. Poison deal as much damage in all levels and the damage loss from the unit for just using optional posion is not even worth in lv2 and lv3. In AE I used values 6-3 for lv2 and 7-4 for lv3 . Even with these values people (and me) do rarely use the poison attack unless of closed spaces or instead using lower level bowmen (or any other thing) for poison.

2) I do personally find Legion Enforcer melee+ranged damages too high (specially if melee has first-strike) , Unit has poor HP for a lv3. Maybe just that I do see too much potential in 1 strike units even without existance of XP mod.

3) Legion Guardian XP's insane high , recheck that.

4) Patroness too high damage for a lv3, combined of +line-damage , unit really don't needs Area of Damage in lv3. Maybe add +Marksman or +Skilled to lv4 to make her worth to be obtained appart of the area of damage bonus.

7) Axet Thrower too high melee+ranged damage in all levels. Low HP on lv2, maybe recheck to see if there is something wrong, but I find unit too powerful.

8 ) Fire guardian too terribly underpowered , there is no pricement that can fix these stats. As well in lv2.

9) Steel Wyrm too powerful melee for also 6-2 backstab, still low ressists, just a mention so you can recheck if there is something wrong in here.

10) Steel Splicer capable to defeat in 1vs1 a lv2 figther and being a berserking unit, indeed very overpowered.

11) Steel Vorpal melee damages too high (11-4) to also get +slows special.

12) Forest Spirit too high melee+ranged damage, maybe try 5-4 for melee.
