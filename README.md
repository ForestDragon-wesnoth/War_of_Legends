# War of Legends
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The War of Legends is an add-on for the [Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org), a turn-based strategy game.
This add-on is a multiplayer era featuring my favourite factions.
It is required as a dependency to play the following campaigns:

## Installing '**War of Legends**'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released versions of War of Legends should be installed from Battle for Wesnoth’s
official add-ons servers, via Battle for Wesnoth’s built-in add-ons manager,
which can be accessed via the “Add-ons Manager” button in the main menu.

Players who know how to use [Github](https://github.com) may clone our Git repository, which is to
be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/knyghtmare/War_of_Legends) repository, into Battle for Wesnoth’s
“[userdata](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/EditingWesnoth#Where_is_my_user_data_directory.3F)/data/add-ons/” directory.
The benefits of this is that you can try out the unreleased versions and let the author know of any bugs.
