War of Legends
==============

The War of Legends is an add-on for the [Battle for Wesnoth] [1], a turn-based strategy game.
This add-on is a multiplayer era featuring my favourite factions.
It is required as a dependency to play the following campaigns:
1. The Legend Begins
2. Hero of Irdya
3. A Song of Fire
4. War of the Jewel
5. Aria of the Dragon Slayer

Installing 'War of Legends'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released versions of War of Legends should be installed from Battle for Wesnoth’s
official add-ons servers, via Battle for Wesnoth’s built-in add-ons manager,
which can be accessed via the “Add-ons Manager” button in the main menu.

Players who know how to use [Github] [2] may clone our Git repository, which is to
be found on my [GitHub] [3] repository, into Battle for Wesnoth’s
“[userdata][4]/data/add-ons/” directory.
The benefits of this is that you can try out the unreleased versions and let the author know of any bugs.
