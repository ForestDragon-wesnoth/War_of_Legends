    description= _ "One of the few warrior groups to survive the Age of Patience, Skyrunners choose to sacrifice the immense speed of the Pathfinders in favor of equipping themselves with more substantial armor -- though this is still exceptionally light by most standards. In times of peace, their relative strength and skill with the lightning cipher won them a place as the honor guard to the members of the Council, but now they take up once again the old mantle of war."
