They have devoted themselves to developing their own agility, and long practice has granted them an almost inhuman speed. And, when they deem it necessary, their fluid grace and skill with their glaive allow them to strike like the thunder they wield, catching distracted foes unawares."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BACKSTAB}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
